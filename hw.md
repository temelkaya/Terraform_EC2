# Assignment: Create autoscaling group + application load balancer
- take existing code base, and build upon it to add an autoscaling group and an application load balancer (use whichever configurations you feel fit)
- Be sure to modify variables for your own aws account to work (keypair, ami's etc)
- [autoscaling documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/autoscaling_group)
- [application load balancer documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/lb)

## Bonus 
- Create s3 bucket on existing code base (do it in an individual file)
- check alb documentation and see the access logs code block and see if you are able to get that portion of the code working

### Due Nov.3 2022
