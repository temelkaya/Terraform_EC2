# Communication basics for job interview
- start high level / broad then go into detail
- key to communication - always keep the conversation going, try not to stall or make any deadend talking points.
- To also showing outward ambition and willingess to learn things that you do not have experience in

## Example
- Question: "What is your experience working with the cloud"?
- Way to answer: I've worked with <example cloud provider> and then you can talk about the different services that you've worked with in the cloud.
- List of services: then go in depth about each service and what you have worked on with them / how you leveraged them
- when it comes to talking about simple experience - word it in an advanced way using technical / corporate vocabulary.
- when asked about experience working with a cloud provider - talk about the services of that cloud provider then speak about tooling involved

### Job environment communication keys
- when you dont know something - communicate to your co workers to learn better / work together to learn better (team work) 
- Focus on doing self research before asking for help to show initiative that you are willing to understand / learn
- Self research: google the topic, try all that you can do before asking for help and always be kind.

### General questions
- Explain to me what is DevOps to you? Devops is a style of working / a culture / philosophy that implements CI/CD practices to accelerate the software delivery lifecycle and team itself. Devops culture also involves utilizing agile methodologies to work as effeciently as possible to modern day IT standards.
- Extra topic to throw into the devops culture --> devops is not about the tooling, its about how you use the tooling. 

- Why do you want to work here? Answer in a way that explains how you wish to be a part of their team to help make a great impact on their technologies - also mention how you wish to grow and learn as a part of their organization.
